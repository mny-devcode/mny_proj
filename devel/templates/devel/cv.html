                    <h1>Some personal, important and useful information about me</h1>

                <div class="section_content">
<h3 class="personal">Security: one of the most important things not just in the IT sector, nor just in the digital world..., but everywhere!</h3>
I am security, development-improvement and quality-oriented, who is good at logical tasks and helps his superiors, colleagues, team members/team.<br>
I have more than 15 years of experience in repairing computers, I am interested in the software part, but I also did hardware works too.<br>
After replacing the hardware, if it was necessary, I reached for the software part and got it to work.<br>
It also happened more than once that important data was/were accidentally deleted from the HDD/USB. I brought it back. I also rescued what was still possible from a dead HDD/USB (if the USB is not "short-circuited"!). There were also cases where someone better than me couldn't cope with a problem for hours. He didn't believe that I would succeed. Not even in finding the source of the problem! Since I didn't know what he was looking at and what he wasn't looking at, I indicated the origin of the problem relatively quickly, within minutes.<br>Similar situations arose elsewhere, I won't go into detail because I don't remember them all. On&nbsp;the other hand, yes, that I can find it, make it, fix it, or give advice on what is worthwhile.<br>
Most of all, I would like to validate this knowledge, in the long term, and make use of it by learning to program excellently.<br>
However, I already have several years of machine handling and installation behind me.<br>
Including machine settings, 3D camera settings (KEYENCE), QR/DMC code reader (KEYENCE).<br><hr><br>
I follow ethical and professional standards during the execution of tasks.<br>
I inform my supervisor about the information and progress related to the task entrusted to me on the requested regularity.<br><br>
Others have said about me: I am too good at doing simple tasks. They are right!<br>
I have a great, strong and deep understanding of even complex things. Maybe not right away, maybe I need some time and a little more practice to see things better, but I'm learning quickly and accurately! Some people think of this precise learning as "correction", <strong><em>YET IT'S NOT!</em></strong> Only, if a person learns something wrong, it takes a long time, sometimes years, to correct it in oneself.<br>
<details><summary>I am able to work under pressure and within deadlines.</summary>
<p>(my passion for <a href="https://www.chess.com/member/dabzse/?ref_id=93533954" target="_blank" title="my chess.com account">CHESS</a> helps a lot in this; although I haven't played much in recent years... but the so-called blind-chess and simultaneous (only 2 opponents wanted to play) also worked; so I can pay attention to several sides, just don't disturb me. I have to practice it again, and then I can also talk about a third thing, even in another language)</p></details>
